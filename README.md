# Sorting-algorithms
I am studying sort methods. My plan is to update this notebook every time I study a new sorting algorithm. Here you will find algorithms and resources with simple information.

In the Jupyter notebook "Sort_options.ipynb" you will find algorithms and resources with simple information about:

    Bubble sort
    Quicksort (opt1 and opt 2)
    Mergesort
